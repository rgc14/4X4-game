# 4X4-game
READ ON SOURCE BLOB
This is a minsweeper like game, there is a by 4 by 4 grid like this:
A1 A2 A3 A4
B1 B2 B3 B4
C1 C2 C3 C4
D1 D2 D3 D4
the computer chooses one of the options and you have to guess it, if you guess it you win, if you choose a neighbouring one (including diagonals), you are still in the game, if you choose an option that does not border it you lose
I am planning on creating a gui and eventually also making it detect invalid inputs but I will do the gui first
